# Module B: Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a yearly challenge where you solve 25 programming puzzles that get released 
one by one between the 1st and 25th of December. The project contains a single example application; [Day01.kt](./src/main/kotlin/advent/y2017/Day01.kt) 
which you can check out as inspiration.
