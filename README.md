# Kotlin Workshop

After the presentation you can take 3 approaches to go and work with Kotlin.

The most beginner friendly route is to start with the official Kotlin Koans. You can do them in your IDE (they're in the 
[a-koans](./a-koans) module), or do them 
online on https://try.kotlinlang.org

You can also decide to do the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges instead. As an example the [b-advent-of-code](./b-advent-of-code) module 
has the implementation for 2017 day 1 already done. 

And last; if you check out the [c-spring-boot](./c-spring-boot) module you can implement a 'number' service that handles a few end-points for prime numbers 
and fibonacci sequences. Also you can just go and experiment yourself if you want!
